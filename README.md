This project is a simple shopping cart built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can increase or decrease item quantities with the `+` and `-` buttons, delete items with the trash icon, like items with the heart button, and see the total price update automatically in real time.  
Itâ€™s a practice task to apply DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
